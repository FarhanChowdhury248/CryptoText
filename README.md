# CryptoText
A web app that allows you to use famous cryptography methods while visualizing the encryption process.

# How to run the app
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `ng serve` to run the app

# Additional Notes
The app currently features the Morse Code and Caesar Cipher encryptions. I stuck to simple encryption methods as the primary goal for the project was to get accustomed to the stack. Next steps would be to add more complicated encryption methods such as the Enigma (note that a template for this is added, but it is incomplete).
